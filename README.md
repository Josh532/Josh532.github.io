I made this website in one night and half a morning took about 8 hours
Still need to finish the nav bar, thats for a rainy day
for some reason the album zeitgeist is unavabile so ignore that, all other ones work
Small mobile issues such as (spotify asking you to go to app) scroll horizontaly and press 'X' to close it
