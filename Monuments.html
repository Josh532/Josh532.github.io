Monuments to an Elegy is the eleventh studio album by American alternative rock band The Smashing Pumpkins, released on December 9, 2014. It is the band's second album following their 2009 reunion and the
            first to feature guitarist Jeff Schroeder as the only other permanent member alongside Billy Corgan. The album marks a return to a more traditional rock sound compared to its predecessor, 
            Oceania, incorporating elements of alternative rock, grunge, and post-punk. With tracks like “Being Beige” and “Drum + Fife,” the album explores themes of loss, nostalgia, and introspection,
            often with a more straightforward and concise song structure. Monuments to an Elegy received generally positive reviews, with praise for its focused production and emotional depth, though 
            some critics noted its shorter length and simpler sound compared to the band’s earlier works.
            The album performed well commercially, charting in several countries and solidifying the band's place in the modern rock scene.</p>
